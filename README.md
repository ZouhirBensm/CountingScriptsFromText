# CountingScriptsFromText
This code calculates the percentages of presence of script names within a a string.

This project made me extremly familiar with higher order functions. I used several functions to iterate through each string character, determine what script name it corresponds from its ranges property, count the occurence of each script type with the iteration process through the string, calculate the percentages of each script name within the string!

The code uses a source of data that has a array of objects data structure. 

Comments were added, especially at the final function to better understand the process of calculations.
